# Password Generator

## Description 
This project's goal was to create a password generator with 4 different sets of possible variation: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Upon clicking the button to generate the password, the user will be prompted with several windows asking for password length and the inclusion of these 4 sets of arrays. Once the user has gone through these, their password should be generated within the text box above the button.
